## Sign-up form - Odin Project
- Sign-up form with built-in form validation. 
- JavaScript functionality is implemented to validate password entries, making sure they match and are not left blank.
    - If passwords are not a match or an empty field is detected, an error message will appear until the issue is resolved.
